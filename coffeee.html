            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. 
            From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee.
             The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, 
             which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, 
             producing a cup of coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,
              primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways 
              (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
               Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert,
                like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).
                 Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing
                  research on whether long-term consumption has positive or negative effects.

        <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
        <p>
            Although size is what varies most among different cappuccinos,
             there are two main ways of preparing cappuccino: one is the traditional 
             or classical way with a cap of milk foam; the other is the "latte art" way. 
        </p>

            <img src="./coffeecafe/Americano.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Americano Coffee</h3>
            <p>
                The drink consists of a single or double shot of espresso brewed 
                with added water. Typically in the UK (and in Italy) between 1 and 16 
                imperial fluid ounces or 28 and 455 ml of hot water is added to the double espresso
            </p>

            <img src="./coffeecafe/doppio.jpeg" alt="">
            <h3>Doppio Coffee</h3>
            <p>
                Doppio espresso is a double shot which is extracted using 
                double the amount of ground coffee in a larger-sized portafilter basket. 
                This results in 60 ml (2.1 imp fl oz; 2.0 US fl oz) of drink, double the
                 amount of a single shot espresso.

            <h3>Espresso Coffee</h3>
            <p>
                Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, 
                with a viscosity similar to that of warm honey. This is due to the higher
                 concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and the crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency)

            <h3>Latte Coffee</h3>
            <p>
                The beverage is related to a cappuccino,
                 the difference being that a cappuccino consists of espresso and
                  steamed milk with a 20-millimetre-thick (0.79 in) layer of milk foam.

        <div class="box">
            <img src="./coffeecafe/black coffee.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Black Coffee</h3>
            <p>Black coffee is simply a mixture of boiled water and a tablespoon of coffee
                 without the addition of milk, sugar or honey. For lactose-intolerant people,
                  black coffee is boon since there is no milk required to prepare it. 
                  This drink is high in terms of caffeine.
